# ChatterBox

## Chat box made with HTML5, CSS3, Node.JS and Socket.io

#### Write your name, select a color, and join the chat. You'll be able to talk with anyone who joins.

There is no database to store the messages that are sent. The messages are not saved by the server, so every message will disappear when you refresh and/or rejoin the chat.
